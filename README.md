<h1 align="center">Welcome dev ðŸ‘‹</h1>

This is a template project using Next.js, using Prismic as the CMS content provider.

## Install

First of all, install dependencies and packages needed to run the project:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Prismic config

To start our server, it's necessary to configurate the Prismic project that wilb integrate with the project. 

The config file `prismic-configuration.js` is in the root directory.

Each property has its own description in the file.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
